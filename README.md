# Infravenous

Compared to conventional fingerprint authentication, vein pattern technology is more accurate, requires less maintenance, and is unaffected by interference on the skin surface. Infravenous is a versatile, compact, and cost-effective biometric authentication device. To authenticate users, the device uses infrared light to image their finger vein pattern. Our imaging processing pipeline then extracts key features from the pattern and uses a machine learning model to identify the user. This device can integrate with both digital and physical systems, meaning Infravenousâ€™ applications span from physical locks to mobile apps. Ultimately, Infravenous makes cutting-edge biometric technology easily accessible and affordable.
